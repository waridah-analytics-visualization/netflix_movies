# Overview
Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office: manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.
In this project, I did an exploratory data analysis to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.


# Notes
This is part of a datacamp project in the data science track. The goal is to use python to answer whether movies are getting shorter by exploring data, manipulating it and plotting the data to draw the conclusion.


# Config
I used Python jupyter notebook for this project as it allowed ease of access in checking code and completing tasks on the project via datacamp.


# Data
I used netflix data provided by datacamp for this project.


# Visualization
The images in png format visualize the results of analytics in step:
a(3). Visual inspection of data with matplotlib (Netflix movie durations 2011-2020)
b(6). Creating a scatter plot (Movie duration by year of release)
c(9). Movie duration by year of release (Min duration)
